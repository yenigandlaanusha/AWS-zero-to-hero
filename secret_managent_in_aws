Secrets Management in AWS

AWS offers 3 services regardings secrets management
1.System manager
2.Secrets Manager
3.Integrate Hasicrop valut

1.Systems Manager:
we use systems manager to store docker username,docker registry url,db username etc. which are senstive but not that senstive than password.if either username compromises also without password ntg can happen

2.Secrets Manager:
we store docker passwords,db passwords,Certificates.The main advantage of this is it rotates the passwords and certificates without manual intervention.We can configure the rotation policy.If by chance the db password is compromised , it will be automatically secured by rotation of password.But this is costly

3.Hasicorp valut:
If we are multi cloud , this helps as it is open source and has a lot of community working on it we get new feature and it has encryption available

To optimize the cost use both systems manager and secrets manager
If we use multi cloud use hasicorp

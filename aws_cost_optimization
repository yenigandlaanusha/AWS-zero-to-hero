AWS COST OPTIMIZATION

In this example, we'll create a Lambda function that identifies EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.

The Lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ('self') and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped).
For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is not associated with any active instance.
If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.

Snapshot:Create a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and use it as a baseline for new volumes or for data backup. You can create snapshots from an individual volume, or 
you can create multi-volume snapshots from all of the volumes attached to an instance.Snapshot - Image of the Volume
The developer wanted to delete the volume , snapshot but he forgot to delete the snapshots. He deleted the instance by default volume will also be deleted but the snapshots are still are still available.

Steps:
Create an EC2 instance
By default a volume is attached to EC2 instance
Create a snapshot 
Create a lambda function
Give required permissions for the lamda function like describe snapshots,iinstances,volumes,delete snapshots
attach the permissions to lambda
Run the lambda function either in an event driven or manual form
Check for any permission errors
Run the lamda function and if u have any stale snapshots , if program is success then the stale snapshots which are not attached to any running EC2 instances will be deleted.

3.Private Cloud
4.Difference between public and private cloud?
5.Why AWS

Private Cloud - In side the organisation , they have a separate data center.
Previously every organisation if they want server they will buy a server from IBM or any server companies and setup servers in an organisation.But the cost and maintainence of the servers is very high.
To maintain the server they need dedicated employees,cooling system,security etc.And at the end the utilization of servers very less as they deploy only 1 application in 1 server
So in order to use the servers in a better way , the new concept came into limelight that is Virtualization.Virtulization is the way of creating virtual servers on the top of server.In this way the useage of server is maximized.
But for all the companies to maintain the server all these is very difficlut and it takes lots of money.AWS took this as a opputurtunity and came into the limelight of public cloud.

Public Cloud- like AWS,Azure,GCP.Now all these companies are providing specific services for our/company needs same as private cloud.With cost effective and with no maintainance.

Why AWS ?
First company to see this cloud as a oppurtunity and came into this so it has more percentage of users and it has more than 200 type of services.
